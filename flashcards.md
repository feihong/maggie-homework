How to convert a fraction of fractions to a product of fractions:

$$
(a/b)/(c/d) = a/b * d/c
$$

---

The interquartile range, abbreviated as IQR, is defined as

$$
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
$$

---

$Q_1$ is also known as first quartile, lower quartile, or 25th percentile. By
its definition, 25% of the data is below this number.

---

The median is also known as $Q_2$, the second quartile, or 50th percentile. By
its definition, 50% of the data is below this number.

---

$Q_3$ is also known as third quartile, upper quartile, or 75th percentile. By
its definition, 75% of the data is below this number.

---

The five-number summary consists of:

- the sample mininum
- first quartile
- median
- third quartile
- sample maximum

---

The box plot is a visual representation of the five-number summary. The whiskers
are the minimum and maximum, the sides of the box are $Q_1$ and $Q_3$, and the
middle of the box is the median.

---

Outliers are data points greater than $Q_3 + 1.5*IQR$ or less than $Q_1 - 1.5*IQR$

---

The range of a data set is the difference between the maximum and the minimum

---

The range and the interquartile range are both measures of spread, but the range
is more influenced by outliers.

---

Compute the nth value of an arithmetic sequence by

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference

---

Sometimes the same word can be a preposition or an adverb. If it has no object,
then it is an adverb.

- Adverb: Jojo just drove past.
- Preposition: Jojo just drove past us.

y is directly proportional to x if there is a non-zero constant k such that:

$$
y = kx
$$

---

y is inversely proportional to the variable x if there exists a non-zero constant k such that

$$
y = k/x
$$

---

z is jointly proportional to the variables x and y, if there is a non-zero
constant k such that

$$
z = kxy
$$

How to find linear regression

(write steps from worksheet)

---

To limit your Google search to a single website, use `site:(domain) (keywords)`.
For example, `site:chipublib.org a-z resources`.

---

A quadratic polynomial is a polynomial of degree 2. An example is

$$
x^2 + 8x - 9
$$

---

The first step when solving an equation with a variable in the denominator is to
find the domain of $x$. For example, in

$$
(x^2 - 3x)/(x^2 + 4x + 3)
$$

we can first establish that $x ne -1$ and $x ne -3$.
